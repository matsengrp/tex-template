\section{Project overview}

\subsection{What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using words that would be familiar to someone who had taken an undergraduate class in the topic.}

\subsection{Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?}

\subsection{How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?}

\subsection{What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?}

\subsection{What is a best case scenario hypothetical result? Try to be as specific as possible. Use your imagination!}

\subsection{What are the potential bad outcomes? Any overall concerns here?}

\subsection{Is there pre-existing work/code that could be leveraged to explore the potential for bad outcomes? To do proof-of-concept investigation to get a first-pass answer for the underlying scientific question?}

\subsection{Are there any other categorically different approaches that could be applied here?}

\subsection{If this is a methods project, what methods will you compare to? Can you get them running before writing new code?}

\subsection{What data will you use? Are there appropriate hold-out sets?}

\subsection{Is it possible that better data would make this project irrelevant?}

\subsection{Sketch the approach, broken down into steps, with expected amounts of time and intermediate steps for each.}

\subsubsection{Stage 1 (X months):}

\paragraph{How do we decide to move onto the next stage?}
